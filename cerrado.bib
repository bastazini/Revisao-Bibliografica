Abstract = {Expansion of agriculture over ecosystem areas is widely recognized as
   one of the most significant human alterations to the global environment
   over the last century. Although food and fiber production are essential
   ecosystem services (ES) to humankind, the clearing of forests for
   agricultural use is associated with changes in land cover which affect a
   wide range of ES at local, regional and global scales. Considering the
   importance of climate change, freshwater scarcity, soil erosion and
   other environmental issues, this paper aims to simulate the impact of
   land-use change on the ecosystem services related to water and carbon
   biogeochemical processes. The system under study is the Taquarizinho
   river basin, located in the eastern region of Mato Grosso do Sul State,
   Brazil, inserted in the upland borders of one of the largest wetland
   systems of the world, the Pantanal. Formerly occupied by Brazilian
   savannah (Cerrado), more than half of Taquarizinho watershed was
   converted both to agriculture and pasture lands since the 1960s. In
   order to quantify the impact of land-use change on ES provided by
   Taquarizinho over the years, this paper introduces the hydro-carbon
   model, which dynamically represents ecosystem services related to water
   and carbon cycles, such as canal discharge, groundwater recharge,
   evapotranspiration, biomass carbon sequestration, litter carbon
   sequestration, and soil carbon sequestration. The hydro-carbon model
   uses emergy for estimating the monetary value of ecosystem services
   provided by the river basin under different land-use scenarios. In this
   paper, extreme scenarios represent typical land-use types in
   Taquarizinho basin: native savanna (NS), agroforestry systems (AF),
   conventional tillage agriculture (CT), no-tillage multiple cropping
   agriculture (NT), degraded pastures (DP), and pastures under improved
   management (IP). Results in this paper reveal a hierarchy related to
   water and carbon ES provision, in descending order: native savanna (247
   EM\$ ha(-1) y(-1)), agroforestry system (204 EM\$ ha(-1) y(-1)),
   pastures under improved management (180 EM\$ ha(-1) y(-1)), no-tillage
   multiple cropping agriculture (160 EM\$ ha(-1) y(-1)), degraded pastures
   (104 EM\$ ha(-1) y(-1)) and conventional tillage agriculture (75 EM\$
   ha(-1) y(-1)). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Climate change and land use from Brazilian cow-calf production amidst
   diverse levels of biodiversity conservation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {342},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Pasture-based animal production is a determinant in shaping biomes
   worldwide, with historical and cultural effects. It affects land use,
   landscapes, ecosystem conservation, and climate change. Converting
   forages into high-value-food livestock production evolved as essential
   for human nutrition and health, economics, and poverty reduction. A
   better understanding of the interactions of livestock with the
   environment to fundament alternatives to mitigate impacts of beef
   production comes up against the scarcity of studies on the environmental
   impact of livestock systems that include estimates of biodiversity and
   the availability of specific indicators. In this work, we provide
   elements to support the proposition of sustainable practices, looking at
   cow-calf production in different Brazilian biomes to estimate their
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and land use (LU) amidst diverse levels
   of biodiversity conservation. GHG emissions and LU were analyzed using
   the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. We express the level of
   biodiversity conservation as average scores (1 = low conservation to 5 =
   high conser-vation) of four indicators: native vegetation, monocultures,
   soil organic carbon, and endangered fauna and flora species in each
   biome. Respectively in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal, GHG
   emissions were 7.14, 6.54, 9.10, and 13.49 kg of CO2 equivalent {*}kg of
   live weight gain (LWG)(-1), the LU was 89.30, 87.94, 158.84, and 307.24
   m(2)y {*}kg LWG(-1), and the mean biodiversity scores were 4.5, 3.0,
   3.5, and 4.3. These results demonstrate that the proposed indicators
   were able to show differences in biodiversity between the studied
   systems consistent with current scientific knowledge. This information
   contributes to the definition of different production priorities
   according to the peculiarities and current levels of biodiversity
   conservation in each biome. Holistic management and different pasture
   improvement strategies have been suggested to increase production,
   decrease environmental impacts, and regenerate ecosystems. Thus, new
   opportunities arise to mitigate impacts without generating other
   problems, increase income, improve the quality of life, and preserve
   sensitive areas that make up the diversity of Brazilian biomes.},

Abstract = {This paper reviews current knowledge on changes in carbon stocks upon
   land use conversion in the Brazilian Cerrado. First, we briefly
   characterize the savanna ecosystem and summarize the main published data
   on C stocks under natural conditions. The effects of increased land use
   pressure in the Cerrado and current uncertainties of estimations of
   changes in land cover and land use are reviewed next. Thereafter, we
   focus on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics due to changes in land use,
   particularly conversion to pastures and soybean-based cropping systems,
   and effects of management practices such as soil fertilization, crop
   rotations and tillage practices. Most studies considered here suggest
   that more intensive agriculture, which include no-till practices and the
   implementation of best or recommended management practices (RMP),
   reduces SOC losses after land use conversion from conventional
   tillage-based, monocropping systems; however, these studies focussed on
   the first 0.3 m of soil, or less, and seldom considered full carbon
   accounting. To better estimate possible global warming mitigation with
   agriculture in the Cerrado more comprehensive studies are needed that
   analyse fluxes of the biogenic greenhouse gases (GHG: CO2, N2O and CH4)
   to determine the net global warming potential (GWP). Follow up studies
   should include the application of an integrated modelling system,
   comprised of a Geographic Information System (GIS) linked to dynamic
   modelling tools, to analyse SOC dynamics and make projections for
   possible changes in net C flows in the Cerrado region upon defined
   changes in soil use and management. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {The Brazilian Cerrado: assessment of water and soil degradation in
   catchments under intensive agricultural use},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {8},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1154-1180},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The Brazilian Cerrado is recognized as one of the most threatened biomes
   in the world, as the region has experienced a striking change from
   natural Cerrado vegetation to intense cash crop production. This paper
   reviews the history of land conversion in the Cerrado and the
   development of soil properties and water resources under past and
   ongoing land use. We compared soil and water quality parameters from
   different land uses considering 80 soil and 18 water studies conducted
   in different regions across the Cerrado to provide quantitative evidence
   of soil and water alterations from land use change.
   Following the conversion of native Cerrado, significant effects on soil
   pH, bulk density and available P and K for croplands and less-pronounced
   effects on pastures were evident. Soil total N did not differ between
   land uses because most of the sites classified as croplands were
   nitrogen-fixing soybeans, which are not artificially fertilized with N.
   In contrast, water quality studies showed nitrogen enrichment in
   agricultural catchments, indicating fertilizer impacts and potential
   susceptibility to eutrophication. Regardless of the land use, P is
   widely absent because of the high-fixing capacities of deeply weathered
   soils and the filtering capacity of riparian vegetation. Pesticides,
   however, were consistently detected throughout the entire aquatic
   system. In several case studies, extremely high-peak concentrations
   exceeded Brazilian and European Union (EU) water quality limits, which
   were potentially accompanied by serious health implications. Land use
   intensification is likely to continue, particularly in regions where
   less annual rainfall and severe droughts are projected in the
   northeastern and western Cerrado. Thus, the leaching risk and
   displacement of agrochemicals are expected to increase, particularly
   because the current legislation has caused a reduction in riparian
   vegetation. We conclude that land use intensification is likely to
   seriously limit the Cerrado's future regarding both agricultural
   productivity and ecosystem stability. Because only limited data are
   available, we recommend further field studies to understand the
   interaction between terrestrial and aquatic systems. This study may
   serve as a valuable database for integrated modelling to investigate the
   impact of land use and climate change on soil and water resources and to
   test and develop mitigation measures for the Cerrado. Copyright (C) 2014

Title = {Conserving the Cerrado and Amazon biomes of Brazil protects the soy
   economy from damaging warming},
Journal = {WORLD DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {146},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In tropical regions, widespread loss of native forest and savanna
   vegetation is increasing extreme heat, particularly in agricultural
   regions. Using the case of rising extreme heat from lost forest and
   savanna vegetation in Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado regions, we modeled
   losses to soy production, the region's principal economic activity. We
   assessed two types of extreme-heat regulation values: the value of
   avoided extreme-heat exposure of soy from the conservation of
   neighboring ecosystems and the value of lost revenue due to increased
   extreme heat exposure from increased ecosystem conversion. Our modeling
   combines empirical estimates of (1) the influence of ecosystem
   conversion on extreme heat over neighboring cropland, (2) the impacts of
   extreme heat on agricultural yields, and (3) native vegetation area,
   agricultural area, and crop prices. We examine lost soy value from land
   conversion over the period 1985 to 2012, potential losses from further
   conversion under plausible land and climate change scenarios
   (2020-2050), and the future value of conservation of the region's
   remaining ecosystem area near soy. Soy revenue lost due to extreme heat
   from native vegetation loss (1985-2012) totaled 99 (2005USD) ha(-1) for
   2012-2013 growing season. By 2050, agricultural growth, ecosystem
   conversion, and climate change could boost extreme-heat regulation
   values by 25\% to 95\%. Future values were strongly sensitive to changes
   in agricultural density, rates of native vegetation loss, and climate.
   Extreme-heat regulation values were largest in the Cerrado biome and the
   southeastern Amazon. Relative to land values, the value of extreme heat
   regulation was largest relative to the carbon value of biomass in the
   Cerrado. By regulating the exposure of agriculture to extreme heat,
   ecosystem conservation can create considerable value for the soy sector.

Title = {THE ROLE OF FUTURE LAND-USE CHANGE IN SOUTHERN AMAZONIA TO REACH THE
   AIMS OF BRAZIL'S NATIONAL CLIMATE PLAN},

Abstract = {During the 1990s and early 2000s, forestry and agriculture were the main
   emitters of greenhouse gases in Brazil, contributing to approximately 80
   \% of the total national CO2-equivalent emissions. In Southern Amazonia,
   the conversion of forest and Cerrado ecosystems to pasture and cropland
   particularly resulted in high CO2-emissions from soils and vegetation.
   Other emissions from the agricultural sector include N2O emissions from
   the application of fertilisers and CH4 emissions from livestock. Only
   recently was significant progress made in decoupling further increases
   of agricultural production from deforestation rates. Given the expected
   increase in global demand for food, bioenergy and biomaterials in the
   coming years, it is uncertain whether the established policies and
   available technological potentials to improve crop productivity are
   sufficient to prevent further expansion of agricultural area. This would
   be an essential prerequisite for slowing down deforestation considerably
   and for achieving the national climate targets of reducing the annual
   greenhouse gas emission by 43 \% in 2030. In order to explore the future
   pathways of land-use change in Southern Amazonia until 2030, we
   developed a set of four scenarios consisting of storylines and simulated
   high-resolution land-use maps. The scenarios take into consideration
   changing agricultural production due to changing commodity demands from
   domestic and global markets, as well as different assumptions regarding
   agricultural intensification and the effectiveness of policies targeting
   the preservation of protected areas. Based on the generated maps,
   greenhouse gas emissions (N2O, CH4 and CO2) were calculated. Emission
   reductions compared to the reference year 2010 could be achieved under
   the Legal Intensification (-38 \%) and Sustainable Development (-79 \%)
   scenarios. In both cases, the results indicate that further agricultural
   intensification together with strict conservation policies are essential
   requirements to slow down the loss of natural ecosystems and at the same

Title = {Carbon uptake and water vapor exchange in a pasture site in the
   Brazilian Cerrado},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {594},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {As Brazil becomes one of the largest agricultural and livestock
   producers, the expansion of cultivated pasture and crop areas in the
   Cerrado region is expected to cause significant changes in carbon and
   water vapor fluxes. While this change in land use promotes modifications
   in regional carbon uptake and water cycle, eddy covariance studies
   carried out in pasture areas in the Brazilian Cerrado remain scarce. The
   present study aimed to quantify the carbon uptake and water vapor
   exchange of these areas in the Brazilian Cerrado. The experimental site
   was installed in an area covered by Brachiaria sp. in Tres Lagoas - MS,
   Brazil. Data were collected during two hydrological years (2016-2017 and
   2017-2018). Pasture strongly acted as a carbon sink; its total
   accumulation reached 208.9 (+/- 9.6) and 171.8 (+/- 15.8) g C m(-2) in
   the first and second hydrological years, respectively. Average
   evapotranspiration of 2.0 (+/- 1.1) mm d(-1) was observed in the two
   hydrological years. There was significant reduction in
   evapotranspiration at the pasture site during the driest months of the
   year (June and July), mainly in the second hydrological year, which
   recorded an average of 0.4 (+/- 0.1) mm d(-1). The lower recorded water
   availability in the soil led to the release of 86.7 g C m(-2) (over 85
   days) in the dry season of the second hydrological year. Ecosystem-level
   water use efficiency observed during the higher soil water deficit
   facilitated the survival of the grass. This information is the basis for
   further studies about the impact of climate change on carbon uptake and
   water vapor flux by cultivated and natural pasture; additionally, the
   present research will allow comparisons of carbon storage results to
   other ecosystems and to support studies of agrometeorological modeling.},

Journal = {REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Month = {JUL 22},
Abstract = {Research on the dynamics of vegetation distribution in relation to past
   climate can provide valuable insights into terrestrial ecosystems'
   response to climate change. However, paleoenvironmental data sources are
   often scarce. The integration of ecological niche modeling and
   paleoecological data can fill in this knowledge gap. In order to
   elucidate the potential impacts of past and future climate change on the
   distribution of multiple vegetation types, we used 433 occurrence points
   of 100 species to build distribution models of five vegetation types
   occurring in southern Brazil, based on past, current, and future
   scenarios. Past models indicated the existence of a steppe domain during
   the Last Glacial Maximum, with forest expansion during the Mid-Holocene,
   which is consistent with paleoenvironmental data. The current
   distribution model identified a large area that was climatically
   suitable for ecotones in an important protection area threatened by
   agribusiness. The optimistic projections for 2070 predicted an expansion
   of mixed ombrophilous and seasonal semi-deciduous forests to a higher
   altitude and latitude, respectively. The pessimistic projections
   predicted a catastrophic scenario, with the extinction of the steppe and
   the savanna and a major increase of areas unsuitable for all vegetation
   types. The ombrophilous dense forest remained stable in all time
   scenarios, even in the pessimistic future projection. The results of the
   present study reinforce the need for the implementation of policies that
   will reduce greenhouse gas emissions that drive global climate change,
   which may lead to the extinction not only of species but also of
   landscapes as we know them today.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the carbon (C) stock and stabilization of
   soil organic matter in particulate- and mineral-associated fractions
   across different land use systems after 32 years of experimentation in
   the Brazilian Cerrado. The experiment was established in 1991 and was
   performed in Planaltina-DF. The treatments evaluated included continuous
   pasture with monoculture grasses; integrated crop-livestock systems
   under no tillage; continuous cropping under no tillage; minimum tillage;
   and the preservation of the native Cerrado biome in its original
   condition. Soil sampling was performed to a depth of 30 cm. Carbon and
   nitrogen (N) stocks were quantified for the years 2001, 2009, 2013, and
   2023, with soil organic matter fractionation performed on samples from
   2023. Land use change resulted in significant losses of soil C and N in
   areas managed with conventional soil preparation practices. Systems that
   promote plant diversity, such as integrated crop-livestock systems,
   enhanced soil C and N stocks (72.8 and 5.5 Mg ha-1, respectively) and
   increased both particulate organic matter and mineral-associated
   fractions, most of which were in more stabilized forms. Integrated
   crop-livestock systems are management practices that offer an effective
   alternative to present methods in terms of combating climate change and
   supporting ecosystem sustainability.},

Title = {Environmental impacts of Brazilian beef cattle production in the Amazon,
   Cerrado, Pampa, and Pantanal biomes},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {311},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Grazing cattle production plays a fundamental role in rural landscape
   conservation, food security, and bio-economy, allowing for subsistence,
   income, insurance, and food around the world. Conversely, livestock is
   associated with negative impacts on human health, animal welfare, and
   ecosystems. Thereby, a broad knowledge of the impacts of pasture-based
   beef production is essential for proposing sustainable practices and
   systems, particularly in Brazil, due to its importance. In this context,
   this study aims to assess the environmental impacts of beef production
   systems characteristic of different Brazilian biomes and, thus, provide
   baselines that support the future development of differentiated
   mitigation alternatives. Four systems were defined based on the
   relevance of the livestock activity in the Amazon, Cerrado, Pampa, and
   Pantanal biomes. Its main environmental impacts and components were
   identified using the life cycle analysis - LCA method, during the entire
   productive lives of the animals. GHG emissions resulted in mean values
   for Brazilian beef production of 13.32 kg CO2 equivalent per kg of live
   weight gain. The Cerrado presented higher values of terrestrial
   acidification, depletion of metals and fossil fuels, freshwater and
   marine ecotoxicity, and particulate matter formation. The Pantanal was
   more impacting in terms of climate change, water depletion, freshwater
   and marine eutrophication, and the photochemical oxidants formation. The
   Pampa was the region with the highest agricultural land occupation.
   Human toxicity and terrestrial ecotoxicity were negative in all systems.
   Occupation of urban areas, ozone depletion, natural areas
   transformation, and ionizing radiation were not significant, concerning
   other human activities after normalization. The inclusion of different
   impact categories in the analysis offers new perspectives to minimize
   the impacts of Brazilian livestock on the planet. Pasture-based animal
   production systems with greater ecological, water, and carbon footprints
   show better results in indicators related to human health and
   environmental conservation. The intensification of grazing and the
   introduction of more productive forage species may represent new
   opportunities for adding value, improving life quality, and conservation
   of sensitive areas found in different environments that make up the
   diversity of Brazilian livestock production.},

Abstract = {The ever-increasing requirement of land for food production causes
   habitat loss and biodiversity decline. Human activities like agriculture
   are responsible for increases in global temperature, which may preclude
   species' survival if they cannot adapt to new climatic conditions or
   track suitable ones. Although negative impacts of climate change may act
   in synergy with agriculture when dispersion routes are blocked by
   croplands, agriculture is important to local economies. Therefore, the
   demand for land conversion causes conflict among stakeholders and
   decision makers. But can we benefit both economy and environment? Here
   we propose an approach to help find a balance between agriculture
   expansion and biodiversity conservation. We used suitable areas for
   agriculture to identify priority places to implement monocultures. We
   modeled species distributions to avoid sites with high conservation
   value and used species dispersal ability to minimize the distance
   between present-day and future suitable areas for species persistence.
   We used a decision-support tool to find a balance between economic
   development and species conservation, and we conclude that land use
   conversion is a threat for species persistence given that negative
   impacts caused by crops could be exacerbated by climate change. Unguided
   agriculture expansion into future species distribution areas is possible
   due to severe decreases in the areas for species to persist in the
   future. Facing this scenario, applying ecological knowledge to guide
   agriculture expansion is urgent if we want to spare species future
   distribution area in the Cerrado.},

Title = {A conceptual model to assess the impact of anthropogenic drivers on
   water-related ecosystem services in the Brazilian Cerrado},
Journal = {BIOTA NEOTROPICA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {The development of strategies that conciliate anthropogenic activities
   with nature conservation is becoming increasingly urgent, particularly
   in regions facing rapid conversion of native vegetation to agriculture.
   Conceptual modelling enables assessment of how anthropogenic drivers
   (e.g. land use/land cover change and climate change) modify natural
   processes, being a useful tool to support strategic decision-making. The
   present work describes a conceptual model to evaluate water-related
   ecosystem service provision under different land use scenarios in the
   Matopiba region of the Brazilian Cerrado, the world's most biodiverse
   savanna and an agricultural frontier. Model variables were determined
   (direct drivers, indirect drivers, focal components and responses) and
   the Nature Futures Framework was consulted to incorporate
   socio-ecological components and feedbacks. Future scenarios were
   developed considering potential trajectories of drivers and governance
   responses that may impact land use in the region, including the
   possibility of full compliance with Forest Code and implementation of
   the Soy Moratorium in the region. The conceptual model and scenarios
   developed in the present study may be useful to improve understanding of
   the complex interactions among anthropogenic drivers, water-related
   ecosystem services and their potential repercussions for natural and
   social systems of the region. Governance decisions will be critical to
   maintaining the ecosystems of the region, the services it provides and
   the culture and tradition of the people historically embedded in the
   landscape. In acknowledgment of humanity's dependence on nature, the
   importance of inverting the way scenarios are used is highlighted.
   Rather than using scenarios to measure the impacts of different policy
   options on nature, scenarios representing the desired outcomes for
   biodiversity and ecosystem services can be used to inform how policies
   can guarantee ecosystem integrity into the future.},

Title = {Modeling soil organic matter changes under crop diversification
   strategies and climate change scenarios in the Brazilian <i>Cerrado</i>},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {379},
Month = {FEB 28},
Abstract = {In Brazil, land conversion and agricultural management have historically
   accounted for the largest share of the country's greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions, with the Cerrado region being one of the most affected areas.
   Although cropping diversification has been proposed as a potential
   strategy to mitigate GHG emissions through soil organic carbon (SOC)
   sequestration, the long-term effects of these systems in the Cerrado are
   unknown. The DayCent model was used to simulate the impact of crop
   diversification and tillage on SOC dynamics until 2070 ( 50 years),
   including common crop succession systems and crop rotations associated
   with cover crops under climate change scenarios. First, we calibrated
   and evaluated the DayCent model using plant and soil observations from
   three sites in the region, where Pearson coefficients (r values) ranged
   from 0.50 to 0.94 (calibration sites) and 0.53-0.99 (validation site)
   for crop yields, SOC, and nitrogen. We then used the model to
   investigate how cropping systems and climate interact to control SOC
   levels. Results indicate that SOC stocks would decrease under the
   long-term (50 years) soybean-cotton succession, regardless of soil
   management (-0.04 to -0.17 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)). Crop diversification
   with crop rotation and cover crops (i.e., millet, ruzigrass, sunn hemp)
   had the highest SOC accrual potential ( 0.71 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1)),
   resulting in SOC stocks of up to 130 Mg C ha(-1) by 2070. Ruzigrass,
   either single or intercropped with maize on crop succession systems,
   showed substantial potential for SOC sequestration ( 0.55 Mg C ha(-1)
   year(-1)) and could be a viable strategy if implementing more complex
   rotations is not feasible. The SSP2 - 4.5 and SSP5 - 8.5 climate change
   scenarios increased SOC stocks by 6.3 and 8.2\% in SOC across treatments
   by 2070, respectively. Results suggest that diversified cropping systems
   are a promising strategy for increasing SOC sequestration, and they
   offer valuable guidance for enhancing current management practices in
   the region.},

Abstract = {Brazil is the sixth largest emitter of GHG, with land use change and
   agriculture being the main source of these emissions. The recent
   expansion of agriculture in Brazil has been occurring mainly in the
   MATOPIBA region, a territorial division inserted on Cerrado. Clustering
   methods are useful for driving hyper-local GHG emission reduction
   strategies, but they have yet to be applied at the municipal level, nor
   from the emissions of various economic sectors. In order to contribute
   to the identification of the most critical areas in relation to GHG
   emissions for MATOPIBA, this study proposes an approach of municipal
   clustering according to the percentage contribution of Agriculture, Land
   Use Change, Energy and Waste sectors in total emissions. The clustering
   was performed with the k-means algorithm, using the elbow method and the
   silhouette score to define the number of clusters. In addition,
   statistical and geostatistical analyses were conducted to assess the
   consistency and spatial autocorrelation of the groups formed. The
   approach was able to generate six clusters with distinct
   characteristics, showing the heterogeneous profile of GHG emissions from
   MATOPIBA. At the same time, the clustering of similar municipalities can
   help in making decisions about the best pro-environmental measures to
   reduce/remove GHG to contain global warming.},

Title = {Nitrous oxide emissions from sugarcane fields in the Brazilian Cerrado},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {246},
Pages = {55-65},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Brazil meets about 16\% of its energy needs with bioethanol and other
   sugarcane products and leads the world in biofuel energy production.
   However, there are concerns over the environmental credentials of the
   sugarcane given the high emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) - a potent
   greenhouse gas - associated with its production. We quantify N2O fluxes
   from a sugarcane experiment in the Brazilian Cerrado over an entire
   year, comparing the magnitude of response to different fertilizer
   treatments: mineral nitrogen (N), a liquid residue from bioethanol
   distillation known as vinasse (V) and a combination of both (NV), on
   irrigated and nonirrigated plots. We find that soil N2O fluxes in plots
   subjected to the NV treatment are, on average, at least three times
   higher than those in the other treatments, resulting in four times the
   emissions intensity per yield than when mineral N or vinasse were
   applied alone. We also find that irrigation has a positive effect on N2O
   emissions in the first two weeks after treatment addition and on annual
   sugarcane yield. Emission factors, defined as net N emissions as N2O as
   a percentage of the total mineral N added, vary from 0.05 to 4.6\%
   according to treatment. Sugarcane production in the Cerrado is a
   significant source of N2O, due to the synergistic effect of mineral N
   fertilizer and vinasse. Using vinasse as the main fertilizer, or
   applying N and vinasse at widely spaced intervals are effective
   strategies for climate change mitigation, plant nutrition, waste
   management and cost-efficient production.},

Title = {Short-term conservation agriculture and biomass-C input impacts on soil

Abstract = {Conservation agriculture (CA) is an effective tool that is used to
   increase soil C sequestration and enhance soil quality and agronomic
   productivity. However, rigorous empirical evidence from Southeast Asia,
   particularly in the Cambodian agro-ecosystem, is still scarce. We
   hypothesized that high and diversified biomass-C inputs in CA might be
   the first step toward to increase SOC in the topsoil by creating the C
   flow to support C storage overtime. Thus, the aim of this study was to
   quantify the short-term (i.e., five year) impacts of soil management and
   cropping systems on soil organic C (SOC), soil total N (STN),
   particulate organic C (POC) and mineral-associated organic C (MAOC).
   There were three distinct experiments comprised of a combination of
   cover and main crops including rice-, soybean- and cassava-based
   cropping systems, hereafter designated as RcCS, SbCS and CsCS,
   respectively. The experimental plots were laid out in a randomized
   complete block design with three replicates. Soil management treatments
   included conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) and a selected
   adjacent area of reference vegetation (RV). Soil sampling was conducted
   in 2011 and 2013 at seven depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-40, 40-60, 6080
   and 80-100 cm). Soil management and crop sequences significantly
   affected SOC and STN stocks in all three cropping systems. On average,
   NT SOC stocks at 0-5 cm depth was greater than those of CT by 10\%, 20\%
   and 18\% and STN stocks by 8\%, 25\% and 16\% for RcCS, SbCS and CsCS,
   respectively. SOC levels followed the order RV > NT > CT. SOC stocks in
   the subsoil layers were consistently lower in NT than in CT in all three
   cropping systems. POC stocks at 0-5 cm depth in NT were on average 22\%,
   20\% and 78\% greater than those in CT in RcCS, SbCS and CsCS,
   respectively. However, significant differences were detected only in
   RcCS and CsCS. The major POC stocks were found at 0-20 cm depth. NT
   treatments in SbCS stored 9\% greater MAOC stocks at 0-5 cm depth than
   those in CT, and an increasing trend of NT was observed in RcCS and
   CsCS. In all three cropping systems, NT systems with diversified crop
   species significantly increased SOC stocks ranging by 6 to 28\% and POC
   stocks by 56-127\% in the surface soils and tended to restore SOC and
   POC in the subsoil layers after five years. The results leads to accept
   the hypothesis that short-term CA associated with high biomass-C inputs
   (particularly bi-annual rotations) promotes SOC recovery in the topsoil
   layer and creates a potential to increase SOC in the subsoil layers when
   deeprooting cover crops are included in crop rotations. (C) 2015

Title = {Deforestation-induced changes in rainfall decrease soybean-maize yields
   in Brazil},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL MODELLING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {486},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Whereas the global demand for food, fiber and energy is increasing, the
   capacity of ecosystems services to sustain agricultural production is
   being compromised worldwide. Brazil is a global food supplier that has
   benefitted from agricultural intensification in the past decades. At the
   same time, expansion of cropland has led to deforestation that, in turn,
   is increasingly affecting rainfall patterns thereby influencing crop
   yields. This study examines how loss in forest cover has impacted
   agricultural yields through change in rainfall. To do so, we use
   modelled data on changes in rainfall patterns due to deforestation as
   input to a crop model. We assess yield changes within the soybean-maize
   double cropping system, the country's most relevant agricultural system,
   in five states within the Amazon and Cerrado biomes. Findings revealed
   that soybean and maize yields would have been respectively 6.6 \% and
   9.9 \% higher per year in the last decade if rainfall patterns hadn't
   been altered by deforestation from 1982 onwards. Although agricultural
   efficiency improved between 2011 and 2020, it was insufficient to offset
   the negative effect of altered rainfall on yields. Our paper reveals the
   link between deforestation and crop yields, emphasizing the need to
   preserve forest cover for agricultural resilience and food security. It
   reinforces the critical role of forests in regulating the water cycle,
   particularly in the face of climate change-induced warmer and drier
   conditions that can impact agricultural production and other human
   activities.},

   Agricultural Expansion},
Journal = {LAND},
Year = {2021},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The stabling of livestock farming implies changes in both local
   ecosystems (regeneration of forest stands via reduced grazing) and those
   located thousands of kilometers away (deforestation to produce grain for
   feeding livestock). Despite their importance, these externalities are
   poorly known. Here we evaluated how the intensification and confinement
   of livestock in Spain has affected forest surface changes there and in
   South America, the largest provider of soybeans for animal feed to the
   European Union. For this purpose, we have used Spanish soybean import
   data from Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina and a land condition map of
   Spain. The area of secondary forest in Spain that has regenerated as a
   result of livestock stabling has been similar to 7000 kha for the decade
   2000-2010. In the same period, 1220 kha of high value South American
   ecosystems (e.g., Chaco dry Forest, Amazonian rainforest or Cerrado)
   have been deforested. While these figures may offer a favorable
   interpretation of the current industrial livestock production, it is not
   possible to speak of compensation when comparing the destruction of
   well-structured ecosystems, such as primary South American forests, with
   the creation of secondary forest landscapes in Spain, which are also
   prone to wildfires. Our results highlight how evaluating land use change
   policies at a national or regional level is an incomplete exercise in
   our highly telecoupled and globalized world.},

Abstract = {Tropical ecosystems play a large and complex role in the global carbon
   cycle. Clearing of natural ecosystems for agriculture leads to large
   pulses of CO2 to the atmosphere from terrestrial biomass. Concurrently,
   the remaining intact ecosystems, especially tropical forests, may be
   sequestering a large amount of carbon from the atmosphere in response to
   global environmental changes including climate changes and an increase
   in atmospheric CO2. Here we use an approach that integrates census-based
   historical land use reconstructions, remote-sensing-based contemporary
   land use change analyses, and simulation modeling of terrestrial
   biogeochemistry to estimate the net carbon balance over the period
   1901-2006 for the state of Mato Grosso, Brazil, which is one of the most
   rapidly changing agricultural frontiers in the world. By the end of this
   period, we estimate that of the state's 925 225 km(2), 221 092 km(2)
   have been converted to pastures and 89 533 km(2) have been converted to
   croplands, with forest-to-pasture conversions being the dominant land
   use trajectory but with recent transitions to croplands increasing
   rapidly in the last decade. These conversions have led to a cumulative
   release of 4.8 Pg C to the atmosphere, with similar to 80\% from forest
   clearing and 20\% from the clearing of cerrado. Over the same period, we
   estimate that the residual undisturbed ecosystems accumulated 0.3 Pg C
   in response to CO2 fertilization. Therefore, the net emissions of carbon
   from Mato Grosso over this period were 4.5 Pg C. Net carbon emissions
   from Mato Grosso since 2000 averaged 146 Tg C/yr, on the order of
   Brazil's fossil fuel emissions during this period. These emissions were
   associated with the expansion of croplands to grow soybeans. While
   alternative management regimes in croplands, including tillage,
   fertilization, and cropping patterns promote carbon storage in
   ecosystems, they remain a small portion of the net carbon balance for
   the region. This detailed accounting of a region's carbon balance is the
   type of foundation analysis needed by the new United Nations
   Collaborative Programmme for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and
   Forest Degradation (REDD).},

Abstract = {In Brazil, conservation priority zones, in spite of their key role in
   preserving natural vegetation and its environmental resources are
   frequently located outside the country's public network of protected
   areas (PAs). Here we present the first study on land-use impacts inside
   Brazil's unprotected (i.e. outside PAs) Cost-Effective conservation
   priority Zones (CEZs), for the period 2020-2050. CEZs are conservation
   priority zones that had experienced low levels of human impact in 2020.
   In this study, we consider various governance scenarios, including
   different deforestation control and native vegetation restoration
   policies. To this end, a land-use change model is combined with a
   downscaling method to generate natural vegetation cover projections at a
   0.01? resolution. Results, which include the effects of climate change
   on the expansion of the Brazilian agriculture, project native vegetation
   losses (through deforestation) or gains (through restoration) inside
   unprotected CEZs. If the current pattern of disregard for the
   environment persists, our results indicate that a large share of the
   native vegetation inside Brazil's CEZs is likely to disappear, with
   negative impacts on biodiversity preservation, green-house gas emissions
   and ecosystem services in general. Moreover, even if fully implemented
   and enforced, Brazil's current Forest Code is insufficient to adequately
   protect CEZs from anthropization, especially in the Cerrado biome. We
   expect that this study can help improving the conservation and
   restoration of CEZs in Brazil.},

Abstract = {A major reason for alarm over the rate and magnitude of deforestation in
   Brazil has been concern that the reduction in vegetation releases carbon
   dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG) that may contribute to
   global climate change. While deforestation releases CO2 and other GHG,
   however, tree growth elsewhere absorbs atmospheric carbon (C) through
   photosynthesis. discussions of CO2 releases from tropical deforestation
   have tended to focus on gross releases and have generally not considered
   the effects of carbon uptake. The objective of this paper is to examine
   the net C balance for Brazil, by estimating both CO2 - C release and
   uptake.
   Our approach was to construct a generalized conceptual model of
   ecosystem C cycling that could be applied to any vegetation type and can
   be quantified with available data. the primary C pools in the model are
   the atmosphere, live vegetation, litter and coarse woody debris, and
   soil. Fluxes are represented as transfer between these pools that occur
   as a result of land use change, disturbance or recovery from past
   disturbance by plant growth and accumulation of organic matter. To
   estimate ecosystem areas, we used and adapted the most recently
   completed and current vegetation map available (Stone et al. in press).
   The primary sources for C density data were a report compiled by Olson
   et al (1983) and a subsequent version. We also used an alternative C
   density for closed moist forest from Brown and Lugo (1992). These
   forests play a major role in Brazil's C balance, but there is some
   uncertainty regarding their C density. We attempted to bracket this
   uncertainty by using both high and low values.
   We also used published data to calculate flux estimates. A major flux in
   Brazil's C budget is release to the atmphere resulting from
   deforestation. In 1990, 1.38 x 10(6) ha of closed forest were cleared in
   Brazil. Additionally, about 1.0 x 10(6) ha of cerrado woodland also
   cleared. We also estimated that 0.35 x 10(6) ha of secondary forest were
   cleared that year.
   Total C releases for the country as a whole were 174 - 233 x 10(6)
   tc/yr. The difference was caused mostly by differing estimates in the C
   density of closed tropical moist forests, which resulted in different
   fluxes from deforestation and burning.
   Net changes in pool sizes of our C budget model varied. The total
   vegetation C pool decreased by 160 - 240 x 10(6) tc/yr. The soil pool
   also lost C, about 80 x 10(6) tc/yr as a result of disturbance from
   forest clearing and intensive agriculture. However, the litter/coarse
   woody debris pool increased by 70 - 90 x 10(6) tc/yr. This increase was
   due to transfers from the vegetation pool due to clearing of closed
   tropical moist forest.
   Total gross C uptake by the system was 100 x 10(6) tc/yr of which 60 x
   10(6) was addition to litter and soil pools in secondary forets. Total C
   releases were 120 - 150 x 10(6) tC/yr from deforestatio/burning and 150
   - 180 x 10(6) tC/yr from decomposition. Most of the C released from
   burning was derived from above-ground vegetation but a significant
   amount also came form litter and coarse woody debris, including from
   reburning of residual logs and pastures.},

Abstract = {Brazil is one of the major contributors to land-use change emissions,
   mostly driven by agricultural expansion for food, feed, and bioenergy
   feedstock. Policies to avoid deforestation related to private
   commitments, economic incentives, and other support schemes are expected
   to improve the effectiveness of current command and control mechanisms
   increasingly. However, until recently, land tenure was unknown for much
   of the Brazilian territory, which has undermined the governance of
   native vegetation and challenged support and incentive mechanisms for
   avoiding deforestation. We assess the total extent of public governance
   mechanisms protecting aboveground carbon (AGC) stocks. We constructed a
   land tenure dataset for the entire nation and modeled the effects and
   uncertainties of major land-use acts on protecting AGC stocks. Roughly
   70\% of the AGC stock in Brazil is estimated to be under legal
   protection, and an additional 20\% is expected to be protected after
   areas in the Amazon with currently undesignated land undergo a tenure
   regularization. About 30\% of the AGC stock is on private land, of which
   roughly two-thirds are protected. The Cerrado, Amazon, and Caatinga
   biomes hold about 40\%, 30\%, and 20\% of the unprotected AGC,
   respectively. Effective conservation of protected and unprotected carbon
   will depend on successful implementation of the Forest Act, and
   regularization of land tenure in the Amazon. Policy development that
   prioritizes unprotected AGC stocks is warranted to promote conservation
   of native vegetation beyond the legal requirements. However, different
   biomes and land tenure structures may require different policy settings
   considering local and regional specifics. Finally, the fate of current
   AGC stocks relies upon effective implementation of command and control
   mechanisms, considering that unprotected AGC in native vegetation on
   private land only accounts for 6.5\% of the total AGC stock.},

Title = {Transformation of coffee-growing landscapes across Latin America. A
   review},

Abstract = {In Latin America, the cultivation of Arabica coffee (Coffea arabica)
   plays a critical role in rural livelihoods, biodiversity conservation,
   and sustainable development. Over the last 20 years, coffee farms and
   landscapes across the region have undergone rapid and profound
   biophysical changes in response to low coffee prices, changing climatic
   conditions, severe plant pathogen outbreaks, and other drivers. Although
   these biophysical transformations are pervasive and affect millions of
   rural livelihoods, there is limited information on the types, location,
   and extent of landscape changes and their socioeconomic and ecological
   consequences. Here we review the state of knowledge on the ongoing
   biophysical changes in coffee-growing regions, explore the potential
   socioeconomic and ecological impacts of these changes, and highlight key
   research gaps. We identify seven major land-use trends which are
   affecting the sustainability of coffee-growing regions across Latin
   America in different ways. These trends include (1) the widespread shift
   to disease-resistant cultivars, (2) the conventional intensification of
   coffee management with greater planting densities, greater use of
   agrochemicals and less shade, (3) the conversion of coffee to other
   agricultural land uses, (4) the introduction of Robusta coffee (Coffea
   canephora) into areas not previously cultivated with coffee, (5) the
   expansion of coffee into forested areas, (6) the urbanization of coffee
   landscapes, and (7) the increase in the area of coffee produced under
   voluntary sustainability standards. Our review highlights the incomplete
   and scattered information on the drivers, patterns, and outcomes of
   biophysical changes in coffee landscapes, and lays out a detailed
   research agenda to address these research gaps and elucidate the effects
   of different landscape trajectories on rural livelihoods, biodiversity
   conservation, and other aspects of sustainable development. A better
   understanding of the drivers, patterns, and consequences of changes in
   coffee landscapes is vital for informing the design of policies,
   programs, and incentives for sustainable coffee production.},
